# Reactips

Let's Learn about React.

This repository was made to encompass important, cool and useful information about **ReactJS** and **React Native**. And to force me to learn more deeply about it as well. :)


### What is ReactJS?

According to [React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html), React is a javascript *library* for building *user interfaces*. 

> **Library:** Is a collection of prewritten code snippets that can be used and reused to perform common JavaScript functions.

> **User Interface:** Is the space where interactions between humans and machines/software occur. In other words, is the part of the machine that handles the humanâ€“machine interaction.
